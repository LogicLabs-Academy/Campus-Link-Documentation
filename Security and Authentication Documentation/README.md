## Quick Notes

- Always store refresh tokens securely (prefer **httpOnly cookies** over localStorage).
- Each login session should generate a **unique session ID** tied to the refresh token.
- Never expose admin routes directly â€“ route protection is key.
- Add validation for student email/ID at registration to prevent fake signups.
